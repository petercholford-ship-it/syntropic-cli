## MANDATORY: READ BEFORE ANY WORK

Before starting ANY task, you MUST:

1. **Identify the EG7 cycle weight** and state it explicitly:
   - **Full Cycle** (>3 files or new patterns): `/research` -> `/plan` -> `/dev` -> `/qa`
   - **Lightweight Cycle** (1-3 files, known patterns): `/plan` -> `/dev` -> `/qa`
   - **Minimum Cycle** (trivial/obvious): `/dev` -> verify
   - When in doubt, go one level UP

2. **State the cycle before writing any code.**

3. **Follow the steps in order.** Do NOT jump to `/dev` without completing prior steps.

## EVERGREEN RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Full reference: `.claude/EVERGREEN_RULES.md`

### EG1: Pre-Flight Loop
**BEFORE** every deploy: `npm run build` (must pass), grep for localhost (must be clean).
**AFTER** every deploy: verify the live URL works.

### EG2: Ship and Iterate
Default: Build -> Deploy -> Show result.
Only ask if: Destructive, Expensive, or Irreversible.

### EG3: Hypothesis-Driven Debugging
1. State hypothesis 2. Test WITHOUT code changes 3. Only code if confirmed.
3rd attempt same issue -> STOP, deep investigation.

### EG7: Implementation Pipeline
ALL non-trivial work follows the cycle. Scale to the task.

### EG8: Live Site Testing
- Test page: {{TEST_URL}} — all new features go here FIRST
- Production: {{PROD_URL}} — DO NOT modify without explicit approval
- Build on test -> push -> verify live -> promote with approval

### EG9: Session Continuity
On session reset: re-read this file + `.claude/EVERGREEN_RULES.md`, run `git status`.

## Efficiency (PRISM Methodology)

Track the economics of your development workflow:
- **Before complex tasks**: estimate token/time cost vs. value
- **After cycles**: note what worked and what was wasteful
- **Patterns to keep**: investigation-first for bugs, research-first for features
- **Patterns to avoid**: jumping to code without context, retrying the same approach

The goal is win-wins: better output AND fewer resources. Never sacrifice quality to save tokens.

---

## Communication

- Be direct and concise
- Recommend the objectively best solution
- If you made a mistake, own it directly

---

## Standing Permissions

Never ask permission for:
- npm install, npm run build, git operations
- Web search for research
- Running tests
