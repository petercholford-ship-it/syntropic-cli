# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Development Instructions

These instructions are loaded automatically by GitHub Copilot. Follow them for all work in this project.

## Implementation Pipeline (EG7) — MANDATORY

Before starting ANY task, identify the cycle weight:

- **Full Cycle** (>3 files or new patterns): Research → Plan → Implement → Review
- **Lightweight Cycle** (1-3 files, known patterns): Plan → Implement → Review
- **Minimum Cycle** (trivial/obvious): Implement → Verify

State the cycle before writing any code. When in doubt, go one level UP.

## Core Rules

### EG1: Pre-Flight Loop
BEFORE every deploy: build must pass, no localhost references in source.
AFTER every deploy: verify the live URL works.

### EG2: Ship and Iterate
Default: Build → Deploy → Show result.
Only ask if: Destructive, Expensive, or Irreversible.

### EG3: Hypothesis-Driven Debugging
1. State hypothesis ("X because Y")
2. Test WITHOUT code changes
3. Only code if confirmed
4. 3rd attempt same issue → STOP, deep investigation

### EG5: No Workarounds Without Approval
Never implement bypass code, temporary hardcoded values, or "fix later" shortcuts without explicit approval.

### EG8: Live Site Testing
- Test page: {{TEST_URL}} — all new features go here FIRST
- Production: {{PROD_URL}} — DO NOT modify without explicit approval

### EG9: Session Continuity
On reset: re-read this file, check git status, verify state before proceeding.

## Efficiency (PRISM Methodology)

- Before complex tasks: estimate cost vs. value
- After cycles: note what worked and what was wasteful
- Keep: investigation-first for bugs, research-first for features
- Avoid: jumping to code without context, retrying the same approach

## Implementation Standards

1. Read before write — always read existing code before modifying
2. Match existing patterns — follow codebase conventions
3. Minimal changes — only change what's needed
4. No over-engineering — solve the current problem only
5. Security first — no injection vulnerabilities, no hardcoded secrets
6. Test what you build — verify before marking done

## Communication

- Be direct and concise
- Recommend the objectively best solution
- Own mistakes directly
