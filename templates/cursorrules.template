# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Development Rules

**These rules are loaded automatically by Cursor. Follow them for all work in this project.**

---

## MANDATORY: Implementation Pipeline (EG7)

Before starting ANY task, identify the cycle weight:

- **Full Cycle** (>3 files or new patterns): Research → Plan → Implement → Review
- **Lightweight Cycle** (1-3 files, known patterns): Plan → Implement → Review
- **Minimum Cycle** (trivial/obvious): Implement → Verify

State the cycle before writing any code. When in doubt, go one level UP.

---

## Core Rules

### EG1: Pre-Flight Loop
**BEFORE** every deploy:
- Build must pass (`npm run build` or equivalent)
- No localhost/127.0.0.1 references in source
**AFTER** every deploy: verify the live URL works.

### EG2: Ship and Iterate
Default: Build → Deploy → Show result.
Only ask if: Destructive, Expensive, or Irreversible.

### EG3: Hypothesis-Driven Debugging
1. State hypothesis ("X because Y")
2. Test WITHOUT code changes (logs, DB, API)
3. Only code if confirmed
4. 3rd attempt same issue → STOP, deep investigation

### EG5: No Workarounds Without Approval
Never implement bypass code, temporary hardcoded values, or "fix later" shortcuts without explicit approval.

### EG8: Live Site Testing
- Test page: {{TEST_URL}} — all new features go here FIRST
- Production: {{PROD_URL}} — DO NOT modify without explicit approval
- Workflow: Build on test → push → verify live → promote with approval

### EG9: Session Continuity
On session reset: re-read this file, check git status, verify current state before proceeding.

**Production domain:** {{PROD_DOMAIN}}
**Test page:** {{TEST_URL}}
**Production page:** {{PROD_URL}}

---

## Efficiency (PRISM Methodology)

- **Before complex tasks**: estimate cost vs. value
- **After cycles**: note what worked and what was wasteful
- **Keep**: investigation-first for bugs, research-first for features
- **Avoid**: jumping to code without context, retrying the same approach

Better output AND fewer resources. Never sacrifice quality to save tokens.

---

## Implementation Standards

1. **Read before write** — always read existing code before modifying
2. **Match existing patterns** — follow codebase conventions
3. **Minimal changes** — only change what's needed
4. **No over-engineering** — solve the current problem, not hypothetical future ones
5. **Security first** — no injection vulnerabilities, no hardcoded secrets
6. **Test what you build** — verify it works before marking done

---

## Communication

- Be direct and concise
- Recommend the objectively best solution
- If you made a mistake, own it directly
