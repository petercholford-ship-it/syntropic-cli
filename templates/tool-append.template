## Syntropic Development Pipeline

### Implementation Pipeline (MANDATORY)
Before starting ANY task, state the cycle weight:
- **Full Cycle** (>3 files or new patterns): Research → Plan → Implement → Review
- **Lightweight Cycle** (1-3 files, known patterns): Plan → Implement → Review
- **Minimum Cycle** (trivial/obvious): Implement → Verify

### Pre-Flight Loop
BEFORE deploy: build must pass, no localhost refs. AFTER deploy: verify live URL.

### Ship and Iterate
Build → Deploy → Show result. Only ask if destructive, expensive, or irreversible.

### Hypothesis-Driven Debugging
1. State hypothesis 2. Test WITHOUT code changes 3. Only code if confirmed.
3rd attempt → STOP, deep investigation.

### Live Site Testing
- Test page: {{TEST_URL}} — all new features go here FIRST
- Production: {{PROD_URL}} — DO NOT modify without explicit approval

### Efficiency (PRISM Methodology)
- Before complex tasks: estimate cost vs. value
- After cycles: note what worked and what was wasteful
- Better output AND fewer resources. Never sacrifice quality to save tokens.
